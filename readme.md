# Asteroids

Asteroid's implementation from the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python)
guided project. Cannot really claim any credit for it.

## TODO

Some ideas for improvements from the project final page:

* Add a scoring system
* Implement multiple lives and respawning
* Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
* Add acceleration to the player movement
* Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
* Add a background image
* Create different weapon types
* Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
* Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
* Add a shield power-up
* Add a speed power-up
* Add bombs that can be dropped
